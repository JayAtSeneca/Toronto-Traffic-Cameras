# Toronto-Traffic-Cameras

The Toronto traffic cameras project is a web application that displays live image from traffic cameras located at various intersections throughout the city of Toronto. The project is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The main feature of the project is a map that displays the locations of the traffic cameras and allows users to click on a camera icon to view the live image on the feed. The map also includes other useful information such as the current traffic conditions and the location of construction or incidents that may affect the flow of traffic.

In addition to the map, the project also includes a list of all the traffic cameras and their locations, as well as a search function that allows users to easily find a specific camera by entering the intersection or street name.

The project is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, ensuring that it works well on a variety of devices and screen sizes. The HTML and CSS used in the project follow best practices for accessibility and usability, making it easy for all users to navigate and use the app.

Overall, the Toronto traffic cameras project is a valuable resource for anyone living in or visiting Toronto, providing real-time information about traffic conditions and helping users plan their routes and avoid potential delays.
